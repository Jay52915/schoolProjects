		<h1><center><b> Family </b></center></h1>
		<p>	My Family is somewhat big compared to what people expect. Even so, it's not everyone in my family. I typically only talk of the ones I live with. All families have problems, mine is no exception. We all work it out in some way. It may take time but we work with it. The size of your family, how old each member is, it doesn't matter. What does matter is how things between each person function and if it all functions together or not.</p>
